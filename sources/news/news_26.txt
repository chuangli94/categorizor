Home > U.S.6-YEAR-OLD BOY KILLED BY DOG IN WESTERN NORTH CAROLINA
RALEIGH, N.C.  Jul 8, 2015, 6:10 PM ET By EMILY MASTERS Associated PressAssociated Press [http://a.abcnews.com/assets/images/logo/AP_logo_update_20130709.gif]

A pit bull mauled to death a 6-year-old boy who apparently had climbed over a 4-foot chain-link fence to get into a neighbor's
yard in western North Carolina , authorities said Wednesday.

The Henderson County Sheriff's Office was called to a residence in Hendersonville, south of Asheville, on Tuesday and found the
boy, Joshua Phillip Strother, lying unresponsive in the fenced backyard. The 1-year-old male pit bull there was so aggressive
officers had to shoot and kill the dog so emergency workers could get to the child, sheriff's office spokesman Maj. Frank Stout
said.

Resuscitation efforts were unsuccessful, and the boy died at the scene from wounds to his head and neck, Stout said.

"The child appeared to have died a very violent and quick death," Stout said.

The boy's mother, Amanda Strother, called 911 at 4:17 p.m. Tuesday and told the dispatcher she had gone to the bathroom and lost
sight of the boy for five to 10 minutes and then was unable to get into the neighbor's yard where he had been attacked.

"I was in the house and I heard the back door shut, and I come running and I see him lying in the neighbor's yard," the mother
told the dispatcher, according to the 911 recording of the conversation.

Weeping, she said there was blood on the boy's face and he didn't appear to be breathing. He did not respond when she called his
name and the neighbors were not home, she said.

After Animal Enforcement officers shot the dog, officers had to push down the chain-link fence to access the victim, Stout said.

Strother told the emergency dispatcher that her son and other children routinely climbed over the fence and had played with the
dog in the past. Strother's cousin Kathy Etheridge said Joshua was "just a sweet little blond-headed boy who loved to play
outside."

The neighbors adopted the dog from an animal shelter about three weeks ago, Stout said. The sheriff's office is investigating the
unnamed shelter and the dog's history to discover whether the animal has ever been deemed dangerous.

miley cyrus Forget Kanye — here are the real stars of Madonna’s new video Why celebs are rushing to buy .porn domain names 5 best moments from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction Miley, James Franco and other celebs need an 'Insta-vention'This dog doesn’t wag his tail — he twerks.

A 16-year-old rescue pooch named Mervin the Chihuahua has tongues wagging on the Internet, as users marvel at his resemblance to
rump-shaking pop star Miley Cyrus.

The aging pup’s habit of letting his tongue flop lazily out of his mouth has been compared to the “Wrecking Ball” singer’s
signature facial gesture.

“I think people reference Miley Cyrus to Mervin because of that performance that she did when she was sticking her tongue out all
crazy,” the dog’s owner, Joey Teixeira, told Barcroft TV.

Mervin has gotten some 30,000 followers on Instagram. Cyrus, by comparison, has nearly 24 million.

“I was not expecting him to blow up the way he has,” Teixeira said.
