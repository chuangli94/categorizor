   Shepherd's Veterinary Hospital in Mars, found proof of that inside her stomach when he surgically removed a variety of
   discoveries, including enough hair bands for nearly seven softball teams and enough underwear to last someone more than week.

   "'Doctor I' started pulling handfuls of different items out," Emily Cottle, his head vet technician, said. "It was quite an
   experience to see."
   
   Tiki's follow-up exam Wednesday showed the pet of the Weis family in Butler County is bouncing back quickly from her surgery
   last week.
   
   Tiki hadn't responded to medication to treat vomiting and diarrhea and lack of appetite, then x-rays showed a mysterious mass
   in her stomach.
   
   Ibrahim, known as "Doctor I" to his patients, performed nearly two hours of exploratory surgery.
   
   "And I found this hair band attached to another hair band to another one to another one and to other things again," Ibrahim
   said.
   
   "Four rubber bands, a Band-Aid, eight pairs of underwear and 62 hair bands is a lot to be in a dog's stomach, especially of
   Tiki's size," Cottle said.
   
   Removing it all was like a magician pulling a long string of scarves out of a hat.
   
   "That's exactly what's going on. It was just amazing, and it's not easy. But, thank God, we were able to pull through, and
   Tiki's recovered very well," Ibrahim said.
   
   Sara Weiss recalled the most unusual thing Tiki, her family's pet, had ever eaten prior to this.
   
   "A nerf dart," which the dog swallowed but passed through its system without surgery, said Weiss.
   
   Ibrahim told Pittsburgh's Action News 4 he recently surgically removed 15 pacifiers from the stomach of a different dog, but he
   called Tiki's case "really amazing."
   
   "I was there for the pacifiers and many other different items but not something that big (as Tiki's collection)," Cottle said.
   
   Ibraham said he believed Tiki ate the items over course of a few days.
   
   She'll be back at the veterinarian's office for another follow-up exam this Friday.

« » After running off at the Penasquitos Canyon Preserve, a dog walked 35 miles to reunite with its owner. NBC 7's Greg Bledsoe has
their story. (Published Tuesday, Jul 7, 2015) Updated 4 hours agoA dog that went missing during a hike in San Diego over a week ago has found her way home after traveling more than 35 miles.

Dog owner Kris Anderson says she’s not an emotional person and says neither is her dog, Georgia May, whom she rescued from a
shelter seven years ago.

 * COMIC-CON GOOD FOR AIRBNB BUSINESS
   

“She’s very reserved,” Anderson said, describing her pooch.

The pair recently shared an emotional moment, however, after Georgia May went missing — and somehow managed to find her way home
to Carlsbad after a long, long trek.

 * COMIC-CON COVERAGE
   

On June 27, Anderson says she took her dog on a hike at the Penasquitos Canyon Preserve in San Diego. She admits she ignored a
posted sign saying dogs must be leashed at all times, which she said was probably her better judgment, in hindsight.

“I want to say [Georgia May] is half-wild. She’s run off a couple times,” Anderson explained.

 * HOW TO GET TO COMIC-CON
   

Perhaps not so surprisingly, it happened again.

But this time, Georgia didn't come back, and Anderson says she and a park ranger searched the trail until dark.

 * WOMAN HIT COP WITH BAG OF DOG POOP: POLICE
   

“And he said to me, ‘You know, I’m really sorry to say this, but dogs don’t make it through the night [at the Preserve]. It’s too
brutal,’” she recounted.

The Penasquitos Canyon Preserve is an area known for coyotes.

Still, Anderson says she went back every day in search of Georgia May, holding out hope for eight days before giving up.

“And in the end, I just thought, ‘A week and a couple days – no one can make it out there,’” she said.

But then, came day nine.

“And I work up and thought, ‘Am I dreaming. Wait,’” said Anderson.

Thirty-five miles from that trail, coming from her kitchen, Anderson heard the doggy door open and close.

“And she jumped up on my bed, just like that. [I said] ‘Georgia! Georgia!’” she added.

Anderson says her beloved canine companion has been lying on the couch, resting, pretty much ever since. She says a veterinarian
checked out Georgia May, and said her health is fine.

“She was quite skinny, but she’s gained some weight,” said Anderson.

How Georgia found her way home, we'll probably never know.

“I don't know,” said Anderson. “I would give anything to know the story.”

Well, she says, not quite anything.

“It sounds corny, I know, she's a dog – but to me she's my baby," Anderson told NBC 7. “I never thought I’d see her again, and
she’s special to me.”

Print [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/images/v/print_icon.png]Never get between a Canadian and his mini dachshund.

Shawn Hanson, a British Columbia resident, posted the following heroic story on a Facebook group dedicated to sightings of dangerous animals.

Hanson was filleting a fish on Salmon Beach in Ucluelet, British Columbia, July 2. His 10-pound mini dachshund, Bailey, was at his
side. Suddenly, he wrote, "A f***ing cougar jumps out of the bushes and grabs the puppy."

"I hear a yelp, and see it dragging the puppy off into the bushes. Without thinking I chase in after it, catching up as it stops
to see what is following. I grab Bailey (puppy) with one hand, punch the cougar in the face with the other, and it releases its
grip on her neck," he wrote.

He handed off Bailey to his wife, grabbed his 12-gauge shotgun and headed back into the bushes. The cougar made aggressive moves
towards him and didn't flee when he fired a warning shot.

"I put a round right at its head, and it spun around still moving. I pumped 2 more at the body," Hanson wrote. Here's a photo of
him with the dead cougar.

Hanson told The Huffington Post he "absolutely" felt bad about killing the cougar. "It's sad, because the cats are beautiful," he
said.

Ultimately, though, he believes the shooting was justified. The undernourished animal was desperate for food, which made it
dangerous. It came after Hanson and had reportedly grabbed another dog earlier in the week.

Hanson called the police and conservation officers, who concluded he wasn't at fault.

Conservation officers had been tracking the emaciated animal, the Canadian Ministry of Environment told Good Morning America , adding that the case was closed.

Hanson says his love for his "amazing" pooch motivated him. "She's one of the family, and that's why I reacted the way I did," he
said.

While Bailey is still stiff and sore from the attack, the dog's puncture wounds are healing up well, Hanson said. Meanwhile, he's
embracing his new nickname: "Cougar Puncher."

for $20 each. All of the proceeds from calendar sales will be split between two local charities, Muttville Senior Dog Rescue and Northern California Family Dog Rescue .

 * A Georgia woman has created a "bucket list" for her dying dog, Chester
 * Nicole Elliott got Chester last month from an animal shelter and agreed to foster him
 * In his final days, she's spoiling him with extra treats and oatmeal milk baths

(CNN) Nicole Elliott was browsing a Georgia animal shelter's Facebook page two weeks ago when she saw him: a scruffy charcoal-gray dog
with sad eyes.

His name was Chester. He was about 14 years old. And he was dying of cancer.

"Hospice needed," the profile said. Chester had mast cell tumors spreading throughout his little body. The shelter was looking for
someone willing to give him a home for the final weeks of his life.

The dog's story touched her. But who wants to foster a dying pet? Elliott stepped away from her computer, but she couldn't get
Chester and his plight out of her mind. The next day, she went to Animal Ark Rescue , signed some paperwork and brought Chester home.

"I only hope someone would do the same for me if I was terminally ill," she said.

Now Elliott, 24, has gone one step further. The Columbus, Georgia, woman has created a "bucket list" for Chester and is spoiling
him with extra treats, oatmeal milk baths and outings to parks. It's all documented on a Facebook page, " Chester's final journey ," that has more than 50,000 fans.


"I think he deserves it. He seems to have been neglected in his past life. He is such a sweet boy," said Elliott, who works as an
administrative assistant. "I have been trying to get a feel for what he is capable of, and most of the things are general doggy
things like going to the park and eating tons of treats."

Chester seems pretty sleepy today. I'm sure the meds are making him groggy. His tummy feels better though. He had a small "photo
shoot" today. Thanks to Charla for coming to us so we didn't have to leave the house. She got a few while he took a potty break
outside. You are a sweet lady! Can't wait to have those pictures forever! They will mean so much! We hope everyone is having a
great night. It's hard to respond to everyone, but know we feel ALL of the love. Thank you all so much! We are going to take it
easy tonight. Keep us in your thoughts and prayers. Xoxo 💙💙 Chester and Nikki

Over the past 10 days, Chester has been living like a king. He gets to eat pretty much anything he wants. He chews on squeaky toys
and enjoys belly rubs. On road trips, he sits on the center console of Elliott's car, where he can snuggle against her arm and
look out the windshield.

Although he is weak, Chester still wags his tail like mad when excited.

"He follows me everywhere, and when I walk out the door, he is usually right behind me. I can tell he has been enjoying all of the
love he has gotten. And the food is his favorite part," she said.

In the near future, Elliott hopes to take him on a day trip to the beach and maybe to visit sick kids or hospice patients to help
cheer them up.

"It all depends on him, though," she said. Elliott is sensitive to critics on Facebook who say too many bucket-list activities
will tire Chester out. "We don't want to make him do anything that makes him uncomfortable."

Chester appears to be a mixed breed -- maybe part miniature schnauzer. When he arrived at Animal Ark Rescue in April, his fur was
overgrown, and he had a large tumor under one leg.

"He had not been taken care of in a while," said Sabine Stull, the shelter's executive director.

The shelter cleaned him up and had the tumor surgically removed, only for others to soon appear. Resigned to the inevitable,
shelter staffers sought hospice care for Chester and were thrilled when Elliott showed up.

"It's absolutely wonderful what she's doing for him," said Stull. "It's really something. This is not an easy thing to do."

Veterinarians are not sure how much time Chester has left. It could be anywhere from days to several months, Elliott said. The dog
is on pain medication to keep him comfortable.

In the meantime, Chester's bucket list has brought international media attention and an outpouring of support on Facebook and Instagram . Elliott has started an online campaign to fund the hospice program at Animal Ark Rescue and is hoping Chester's story will inspire others to foster terminally ill dogs
and cats.

"All of the kind words and support help me get through it. I have cried many happy tears reading the comments," she said.

"It will be very hard (to say goodbye to him), but I know the legacy he is leaving behind makes it easier. I am already in love
with him and feel lucky to be there for the remainder of his life."
