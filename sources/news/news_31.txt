miley cyrus Forget Kanye — here are the real stars of Madonna’s new video Why celebs are rushing to buy .porn domain names 5 best moments from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction Miley, James Franco and other celebs need an 'Insta-vention'This dog doesn’t wag his tail — he twerks.

A 16-year-old rescue pooch named Mervin the Chihuahua has tongues wagging on the Internet, as users marvel at his resemblance to
rump-shaking pop star Miley Cyrus.

The aging pup’s habit of letting his tongue flop lazily out of his mouth has been compared to the “Wrecking Ball” singer’s
signature facial gesture.

“I think people reference Miley Cyrus to Mervin because of that performance that she did when she was sticking her tongue out all
crazy,” the dog’s owner, Joey Teixeira, told Barcroft TV.

Mervin has gotten some 30,000 followers on Instagram. Cyrus, by comparison, has nearly 24 million.

“I was not expecting him to blow up the way he has,” Teixeira said.
