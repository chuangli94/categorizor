miley cyrus Forget Kanye — here are the real stars of Madonna’s new video Why celebs are rushing to buy .porn domain names 5 best moments from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction Miley, James Franco and other celebs need an 'Insta-vention'This dog doesn’t wag his tail — he twerks.

A 16-year-old rescue pooch named Mervin the Chihuahua has tongues wagging on the Internet, as users marvel at his resemblance to
rump-shaking pop star Miley Cyrus.

The aging pup’s habit of letting his tongue flop lazily out of his mouth has been compared to the “Wrecking Ball” singer’s
signature facial gesture.

“I think people reference Miley Cyrus to Mervin because of that performance that she did when she was sticking her tongue out all
crazy,” the dog’s owner, Joey Teixeira, told Barcroft TV.

Mervin has gotten some 30,000 followers on Instagram. Cyrus, by comparison, has nearly 24 million.

“I was not expecting him to blow up the way he has,” Teixeira said.

   Shepherd's Veterinary Hospital in Mars, found proof of that inside her stomach when he surgically removed a variety of
   discoveries, including enough hair bands for nearly seven softball teams and enough underwear to last someone more than week.

   "'Doctor I' started pulling handfuls of different items out," Emily Cottle, his head vet technician, said. "It was quite an
   experience to see."
   
   Tiki's follow-up exam Wednesday showed the pet of the Weis family in Butler County is bouncing back quickly from her surgery
   last week.
   
   Tiki hadn't responded to medication to treat vomiting and diarrhea and lack of appetite, then x-rays showed a mysterious mass
   in her stomach.
   
   Ibrahim, known as "Doctor I" to his patients, performed nearly two hours of exploratory surgery.
   
   "And I found this hair band attached to another hair band to another one to another one and to other things again," Ibrahim
   said.
   
   "Four rubber bands, a Band-Aid, eight pairs of underwear and 62 hair bands is a lot to be in a dog's stomach, especially of
   Tiki's size," Cottle said.
   
   Removing it all was like a magician pulling a long string of scarves out of a hat.
   
   "That's exactly what's going on. It was just amazing, and it's not easy. But, thank God, we were able to pull through, and
   Tiki's recovered very well," Ibrahim said.
   
   Sara Weiss recalled the most unusual thing Tiki, her family's pet, had ever eaten prior to this.
   
   "A nerf dart," which the dog swallowed but passed through its system without surgery, said Weiss.
   
   Ibrahim told Pittsburgh's Action News 4 he recently surgically removed 15 pacifiers from the stomach of a different dog, but he
   called Tiki's case "really amazing."
   
   "I was there for the pacifiers and many other different items but not something that big (as Tiki's collection)," Cottle said.
   
   Ibraham said he believed Tiki ate the items over course of a few days.
   
   She'll be back at the veterinarian's office for another follow-up exam this Friday.

Home > U.S.6-YEAR-OLD BOY KILLED BY DOG IN WESTERN NORTH CAROLINA
RALEIGH, N.C.  Jul 8, 2015, 6:10 PM ET By EMILY MASTERS Associated PressAssociated Press [http://a.abcnews.com/assets/images/logo/AP_logo_update_20130709.gif]

A pit bull mauled to death a 6-year-old boy who apparently had climbed over a 4-foot chain-link fence to get into a neighbor's
yard in western North Carolina , authorities said Wednesday.

The Henderson County Sheriff's Office was called to a residence in Hendersonville, south of Asheville, on Tuesday and found the
boy, Joshua Phillip Strother, lying unresponsive in the fenced backyard. The 1-year-old male pit bull there was so aggressive
officers had to shoot and kill the dog so emergency workers could get to the child, sheriff's office spokesman Maj. Frank Stout
said.

Resuscitation efforts were unsuccessful, and the boy died at the scene from wounds to his head and neck, Stout said.

"The child appeared to have died a very violent and quick death," Stout said.

The boy's mother, Amanda Strother, called 911 at 4:17 p.m. Tuesday and told the dispatcher she had gone to the bathroom and lost
sight of the boy for five to 10 minutes and then was unable to get into the neighbor's yard where he had been attacked.

"I was in the house and I heard the back door shut, and I come running and I see him lying in the neighbor's yard," the mother
told the dispatcher, according to the 911 recording of the conversation.

Weeping, she said there was blood on the boy's face and he didn't appear to be breathing. He did not respond when she called his
name and the neighbors were not home, she said.

After Animal Enforcement officers shot the dog, officers had to push down the chain-link fence to access the victim, Stout said.

Strother told the emergency dispatcher that her son and other children routinely climbed over the fence and had played with the
dog in the past. Strother's cousin Kathy Etheridge said Joshua was "just a sweet little blond-headed boy who loved to play
outside."

The neighbors adopted the dog from an animal shelter about three weeks ago, Stout said. The sheriff's office is investigating the
unnamed shelter and the dog's history to discover whether the animal has ever been deemed dangerous.

« » After running off at the Penasquitos Canyon Preserve, a dog walked 35 miles to reunite with its owner. NBC 7's Greg Bledsoe has
their story. (Published Tuesday, Jul 7, 2015) Updated 4 hours agoA dog that went missing during a hike in San Diego over a week ago has found her way home after traveling more than 35 miles.

Dog owner Kris Anderson says she’s not an emotional person and says neither is her dog, Georgia May, whom she rescued from a
shelter seven years ago.

“She’s very reserved,” Anderson said, describing her pooch.

The pair recently shared an emotional moment, however, after Georgia May went missing — and somehow managed to find her way home
to Carlsbad after a long, long trek.

On June 27, Anderson says she took her dog on a hike at the Penasquitos Canyon Preserve in San Diego. She admits she ignored a
posted sign saying dogs must be leashed at all times, which she said was probably her better judgment, in hindsight.

“I want to say [Georgia May] is half-wild. She’s run off a couple times,” Anderson explained.

Perhaps not so surprisingly, it happened again.

But this time, Georgia didn't come back, and Anderson says she and a park ranger searched the trail until dark.

“And he said to me, ‘You know, I’m really sorry to say this, but dogs don’t make it through the night [at the Preserve]. It’s too
brutal,’” she recounted.

The Penasquitos Canyon Preserve is an area known for coyotes.

Still, Anderson says she went back every day in search of Georgia May, holding out hope for eight days before giving up.

“And in the end, I just thought, ‘A week and a couple days – no one can make it out there,’” she said.

But then, came day nine.

“And I work up and thought, ‘Am I dreaming. Wait,’” said Anderson.

Thirty-five miles from that trail, coming from her kitchen, Anderson heard the doggy door open and close.

“And she jumped up on my bed, just like that. [I said] ‘Georgia! Georgia!’” she added.

Anderson says her beloved canine companion has been lying on the couch, resting, pretty much ever since. She says a veterinarian
checked out Georgia May, and said her health is fine.

“She was quite skinny, but she’s gained some weight,” said Anderson.

How Georgia found her way home, we'll probably never know.

“I don't know,” said Anderson. “I would give anything to know the story.”

Well, she says, not quite anything.

“It sounds corny, I know, she's a dog – but to me she's my baby," Anderson told NBC 7. “I never thought I’d see her again, and
she’s special to me.”
