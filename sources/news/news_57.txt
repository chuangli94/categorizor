A 16-year-old rescue pooch named Mervin the Chihuahua has tongues wagging on the Internet, as users marvel at his resemblance to
rump-shaking pop star Miley Cyrus.

The aging pup’s habit of letting his tongue flop lazily out of his mouth has been compared to the “Wrecking Ball” singer’s
signature facial gesture.

“I think people reference Miley Cyrus to Mervin because of that performance that she did when she was sticking her tongue out all
crazy,” the dog’s owner, Joey Teixeira, told Barcroft TV.

Mervin has gotten some 30,000 followers on Instagram. Cyrus, by comparison, has nearly 24 million.

“I was not expecting him to blow up the way he has,” Teixeira said.

LAWYER: OWNER HAD RIGHT TO KILL DOG AFTER IT ATTACKED PUG

prosecutor in Lapeer County, during Scott's preliminary exam July 8, 2015 in district court in Lapeer. Scott is facing an animal
cruelty charge after shooting his dog in the head with a crossbow arrow in March. He said he was trying to euthanize the dog after

57 CONNECT 17 TWEET LINKEDIN 43 COMMENT EMAIL MOREChristopher Scott's attempt at euthanizing his dog with a crossbow arrow after it killed his smaller pug was not criminal, but
reasonable, and he had just cause to destroy the dog.

That's what his attorney is arguing in a motion to dismiss a felony animal cruelty charge against the Lapeer County man, saying
that Scott's failure in euthanizing his dog "does not render his actions criminal" and that Scott would have been guilty of
harboring a dangerous animal had he not taken any action.

If Scott had successfully killed the dog, named Gemma, "these charges would have never been issued," according to a brief
accompanying the motion.

Scott, 28, of Goodland Township is charged with felony animal cruelty and could be sentenced to four years in prison if convicted
of the charge filed after he shot Gemma in the head with the arrow in March. The approximately 2-year-old dog survived.

FREE PRESS Crossbow case: Can an owner euthanize his own dog?Scott's attorney, Denis McCarthy, is asking the case be dismissed. Lapeer District Court Visiting Judge John Conover did not rule
on the motion during the start of Scott's preliminary exam today. The exam is to continue July 23.

McCarthy wrote in his brief that Scott came home to find the pug, identified as Bambi during the exam, "lifeless in his bedroom and the Mastiff Labrador cross covered
in the pug's blood ... Mr. Scott was now aware that he owned a killer dog and he attempted to kill the dangerous dog to protect
his children, family, friends, and neighbors from other possible attacks."

McCarthy said children, one as young as 4 years old, lived in the home where Gemma killed the pug. Gemma is described as a
65-pound Mastiff Labrador mix while the pug weighed 20 pounds or less.

Scott does not own a gun but has a crossbow and used it in his attempt to euthanize Gemma, according to the brief, which does not
name either dog.

An Oakland County man found Gemma in North Branch in northern Lapeer County two days after she was shot, the 15- to 18-inch arrow
sticking out of the top of her head. Lapeer County Animal Control was notified, the arrow was removed and Gemma recovered and is being held at animal control's
facility.

McCarthy argued in his brief that the criminal statute Scott is charged under is to prevent people who do not have just cause from
knowingly killing, torturing, maiming or disfiguring an animal.

"It does not prohibit an attempt to kill an animal by a person who has just cause," it states, adding that the prosecution
"concede that Mr. Scott had every right to destroy his own animal. However, they insist that because Mr. Scott was unsuccessful in
killing his own dog, he committed a crime in violation of the statute at issue ... In fact, (the statute) provides no basis for a
criminal prosecution in this regard."

According to the brief, a necropsy on the pug found that the way the dog was killed is consistent with being mauled by another
dog. It also describes a dangerous dog as being one that bites or attacks and causes a serious injury or death to another dog.

Gemma, the brief states, "was and still is a dangerous animal. A person who knows that a dog is a dangerous animal and that dog
kills or injures another is guilty of a crime." It said Scott was was not willing to take a chance that the dog "would kill or
injure one of his children, family members or neighbors."

FREE PRESS Saving Gemma: 'My first thought was, is this a joke?'"He had a lawful reason to kill the dog and he attempted to do so. The statute does not criminalize a failed attempt to kill when
just cause exists to actually kill the animal."

The brief also notes that had the owners of the Mastiff-like Cane Corso dogs that mauled and killed a man in Lapeer County last
August euthanized their dangerous dogs, "the victim in that case would still be alive. Yet, here, Mr. Scott is being prosecuted."

The case last year marked the first time in Michigan in which dog owners were charged with murder after a fatal mauling. The
couple pleaded no contest to manslaughter after they were blamed for the death of a jogger who was attacked by their dogs. Their
sentencing is July 14.

Lapeer County Chief Animal Control Officer Aimee Orn testified today and -- when asked by Scott's attorney -- said that an owner
has the right to euthanize his or her own dog if it's done in a quick and humane manner. "It's justified ... if you do it
properly."

When asked what the plan was for Gemma, Orn said the dog does not belong to animal control "therefore we cannot make complete
plans yet." She has previously said that Gemma has not displayed any aggressive behaviors and she would like to find a home for her.

Orn, the lone witness today, testified her office received a call about Gemma being found with the arrow in her head and a tip led
to Scott being identified as Gemma's owner.

Orn said she talked with Scott on the phone, who told her that he had a pug that was killed by coyotes the previous weekend and
that he buried it in the backyard. He said he did not own a big black dog, but that he previously owned a large black pit bull but
it had been given away, she testified.

Orn testified that she sent animal control officers out to the neighborhood to inquire about whether Gemma was Scott's dog and
they determined she was. The county sheriff's office also got involved in the case.

Scott said little during the exam, but told Conover that he was not currently working when questioned about his availability to
continue the exam on another day.

« » After running off at the Penasquitos Canyon Preserve, a dog walked 35 miles to reunite with its owner. NBC 7's Greg Bledsoe has
their story. (Published Tuesday, Jul 7, 2015) Updated 4 hours agoA dog that went missing during a hike in San Diego over a week ago has found her way home after traveling more than 35 miles.

Dog owner Kris Anderson says she’s not an emotional person and says neither is her dog, Georgia May, whom she rescued from a
shelter seven years ago.

 * COMIC-CON GOOD FOR AIRBNB BUSINESS
   

“She’s very reserved,” Anderson said, describing her pooch.

The pair recently shared an emotional moment, however, after Georgia May went missing — and somehow managed to find her way home
to Carlsbad after a long, long trek.

 * COMIC-CON COVERAGE
   

On June 27, Anderson says she took her dog on a hike at the Penasquitos Canyon Preserve in San Diego. She admits she ignored a
posted sign saying dogs must be leashed at all times, which she said was probably her better judgment, in hindsight.

“I want to say [Georgia May] is half-wild. She’s run off a couple times,” Anderson explained.

 * HOW TO GET TO COMIC-CON
   

Perhaps not so surprisingly, it happened again.

But this time, Georgia didn't come back, and Anderson says she and a park ranger searched the trail until dark.

 * WOMAN HIT COP WITH BAG OF DOG POOP: POLICE
   

“And he said to me, ‘You know, I’m really sorry to say this, but dogs don’t make it through the night [at the Preserve]. It’s too
brutal,’” she recounted.

The Penasquitos Canyon Preserve is an area known for coyotes.

Still, Anderson says she went back every day in search of Georgia May, holding out hope for eight days before giving up.

“And in the end, I just thought, ‘A week and a couple days – no one can make it out there,’” she said.

But then, came day nine.

“And I work up and thought, ‘Am I dreaming. Wait,’” said Anderson.

Thirty-five miles from that trail, coming from her kitchen, Anderson heard the doggy door open and close.

“And she jumped up on my bed, just like that. [I said] ‘Georgia! Georgia!’” she added.

Anderson says her beloved canine companion has been lying on the couch, resting, pretty much ever since. She says a veterinarian
checked out Georgia May, and said her health is fine.

“She was quite skinny, but she’s gained some weight,” said Anderson.

How Georgia found her way home, we'll probably never know.

“I don't know,” said Anderson. “I would give anything to know the story.”

Well, she says, not quite anything.

“It sounds corny, I know, she's a dog – but to me she's my baby," Anderson told NBC 7. “I never thought I’d see her again, and
she’s special to me.”

   Shepherd's Veterinary Hospital in Mars, found proof of that inside her stomach when he surgically removed a variety of
   discoveries, including enough hair bands for nearly seven softball teams and enough underwear to last someone more than week.

   "'Doctor I' started pulling handfuls of different items out," Emily Cottle, his head vet technician, said. "It was quite an
   experience to see."
   
   Tiki's follow-up exam Wednesday showed the pet of the Weis family in Butler County is bouncing back quickly from her surgery
   last week.
   
   Tiki hadn't responded to medication to treat vomiting and diarrhea and lack of appetite, then x-rays showed a mysterious mass
   in her stomach.
   
   Ibrahim, known as "Doctor I" to his patients, performed nearly two hours of exploratory surgery.
   
   "And I found this hair band attached to another hair band to another one to another one and to other things again," Ibrahim
   said.
   
   "Four rubber bands, a Band-Aid, eight pairs of underwear and 62 hair bands is a lot to be in a dog's stomach, especially of
   Tiki's size," Cottle said.
   
   Removing it all was like a magician pulling a long string of scarves out of a hat.
   
   "That's exactly what's going on. It was just amazing, and it's not easy. But, thank God, we were able to pull through, and
   Tiki's recovered very well," Ibrahim said.
   
   Sara Weiss recalled the most unusual thing Tiki, her family's pet, had ever eaten prior to this.
   
   "A nerf dart," which the dog swallowed but passed through its system without surgery, said Weiss.
   
   Ibrahim told Pittsburgh's Action News 4 he recently surgically removed 15 pacifiers from the stomach of a different dog, but he
   called Tiki's case "really amazing."
   
   "I was there for the pacifiers and many other different items but not something that big (as Tiki's collection)," Cottle said.
   
   Ibraham said he believed Tiki ate the items over course of a few days.
   
   She'll be back at the veterinarian's office for another follow-up exam this Friday.
