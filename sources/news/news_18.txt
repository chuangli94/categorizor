   Shepherd's Veterinary Hospital in Mars, found proof of that inside her stomach when he surgically removed a variety of
   discoveries, including enough hair bands for nearly seven softball teams and enough underwear to last someone more than week.

   "'Doctor I' started pulling handfuls of different items out," Emily Cottle, his head vet technician, said. "It was quite an
   experience to see."
   
   Tiki's follow-up exam Wednesday showed the pet of the Weis family in Butler County is bouncing back quickly from her surgery
   last week.
   
   Tiki hadn't responded to medication to treat vomiting and diarrhea and lack of appetite, then x-rays showed a mysterious mass
   in her stomach.
   
   Ibrahim, known as "Doctor I" to his patients, performed nearly two hours of exploratory surgery.
   
   "And I found this hair band attached to another hair band to another one to another one and to other things again," Ibrahim
   said.
   
   "Four rubber bands, a Band-Aid, eight pairs of underwear and 62 hair bands is a lot to be in a dog's stomach, especially of
   Tiki's size," Cottle said.
   
   Removing it all was like a magician pulling a long string of scarves out of a hat.
   
   "That's exactly what's going on. It was just amazing, and it's not easy. But, thank God, we were able to pull through, and
   Tiki's recovered very well," Ibrahim said.
   
   Sara Weiss recalled the most unusual thing Tiki, her family's pet, had ever eaten prior to this.
   
   "A nerf dart," which the dog swallowed but passed through its system without surgery, said Weiss.
   
   Ibrahim told Pittsburgh's Action News 4 he recently surgically removed 15 pacifiers from the stomach of a different dog, but he
   called Tiki's case "really amazing."
   
   "I was there for the pacifiers and many other different items but not something that big (as Tiki's collection)," Cottle said.
   
   Ibraham said he believed Tiki ate the items over course of a few days.
   
   She'll be back at the veterinarian's office for another follow-up exam this Friday.

miley cyrus Forget Kanye — here are the real stars of Madonna’s new video Why celebs are rushing to buy .porn domain names 5 best moments from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction Miley, James Franco and other celebs need an 'Insta-vention'This dog doesn’t wag his tail — he twerks.

A 16-year-old rescue pooch named Mervin the Chihuahua has tongues wagging on the Internet, as users marvel at his resemblance to
rump-shaking pop star Miley Cyrus.

The aging pup’s habit of letting his tongue flop lazily out of his mouth has been compared to the “Wrecking Ball” singer’s
signature facial gesture.

“I think people reference Miley Cyrus to Mervin because of that performance that she did when she was sticking her tongue out all
crazy,” the dog’s owner, Joey Teixeira, told Barcroft TV.

Mervin has gotten some 30,000 followers on Instagram. Cyrus, by comparison, has nearly 24 million.

“I was not expecting him to blow up the way he has,” Teixeira said.

 * A Georgia woman has created a "bucket list" for her dying dog, Chester
 * Nicole Elliott got Chester last month from an animal shelter and agreed to foster him
 * In his final days, she's spoiling him with extra treats and oatmeal milk baths

(CNN) Nicole Elliott was browsing a Georgia animal shelter's Facebook page two weeks ago when she saw him: a scruffy charcoal-gray dog
with sad eyes.

His name was Chester. He was about 14 years old. And he was dying of cancer.

"Hospice needed," the profile said. Chester had mast cell tumors spreading throughout his little body. The shelter was looking for
someone willing to give him a home for the final weeks of his life.

The dog's story touched her. But who wants to foster a dying pet? Elliott stepped away from her computer, but she couldn't get
Chester and his plight out of her mind. The next day, she went to Animal Ark Rescue , signed some paperwork and brought Chester home.

"I only hope someone would do the same for me if I was terminally ill," she said.

Now Elliott, 24, has gone one step further. The Columbus, Georgia, woman has created a "bucket list" for Chester and is spoiling
him with extra treats, oatmeal milk baths and outings to parks. It's all documented on a Facebook page, " Chester's final journey ," that has more than 50,000 fans.


"I think he deserves it. He seems to have been neglected in his past life. He is such a sweet boy," said Elliott, who works as an
administrative assistant. "I have been trying to get a feel for what he is capable of, and most of the things are general doggy
things like going to the park and eating tons of treats."

Chester seems pretty sleepy today. I'm sure the meds are making him groggy. His tummy feels better though. He had a small "photo
shoot" today. Thanks to Charla for coming to us so we didn't have to leave the house. She got a few while he took a potty break
outside. You are a sweet lady! Can't wait to have those pictures forever! They will mean so much! We hope everyone is having a
great night. It's hard to respond to everyone, but know we feel ALL of the love. Thank you all so much! We are going to take it
easy tonight. Keep us in your thoughts and prayers. Xoxo 💙💙 Chester and Nikki

Over the past 10 days, Chester has been living like a king. He gets to eat pretty much anything he wants. He chews on squeaky toys
and enjoys belly rubs. On road trips, he sits on the center console of Elliott's car, where he can snuggle against her arm and
look out the windshield.

Although he is weak, Chester still wags his tail like mad when excited.

"He follows me everywhere, and when I walk out the door, he is usually right behind me. I can tell he has been enjoying all of the
love he has gotten. And the food is his favorite part," she said.

In the near future, Elliott hopes to take him on a day trip to the beach and maybe to visit sick kids or hospice patients to help
cheer them up.

"It all depends on him, though," she said. Elliott is sensitive to critics on Facebook who say too many bucket-list activities
will tire Chester out. "We don't want to make him do anything that makes him uncomfortable."

Chester appears to be a mixed breed -- maybe part miniature schnauzer. When he arrived at Animal Ark Rescue in April, his fur was
overgrown, and he had a large tumor under one leg.

"He had not been taken care of in a while," said Sabine Stull, the shelter's executive director.

The shelter cleaned him up and had the tumor surgically removed, only for others to soon appear. Resigned to the inevitable,
shelter staffers sought hospice care for Chester and were thrilled when Elliott showed up.

"It's absolutely wonderful what she's doing for him," said Stull. "It's really something. This is not an easy thing to do."

Veterinarians are not sure how much time Chester has left. It could be anywhere from days to several months, Elliott said. The dog
is on pain medication to keep him comfortable.

In the meantime, Chester's bucket list has brought international media attention and an outpouring of support on Facebook and Instagram . Elliott has started an online campaign to fund the hospice program at Animal Ark Rescue and is hoping Chester's story will inspire others to foster terminally ill dogs
and cats.

"All of the kind words and support help me get through it. I have cried many happy tears reading the comments," she said.

"It will be very hard (to say goodbye to him), but I know the legacy he is leaving behind makes it easier. I am already in love
with him and feel lucky to be there for the remainder of his life."
