« » After running off at the Penasquitos Canyon Preserve, a dog walked 35 miles to reunite with its owner. NBC 7's Greg Bledsoe has
their story. (Published Tuesday, Jul 7, 2015) Updated 4 hours agoA dog that went missing during a hike in San Diego over a week ago has found her way home after traveling more than 35 miles.

Dog owner Kris Anderson says she’s not an emotional person and says neither is her dog, Georgia May, whom she rescued from a
shelter seven years ago.

 * COMIC-CON GOOD FOR AIRBNB BUSINESS
   

“She’s very reserved,” Anderson said, describing her pooch.

The pair recently shared an emotional moment, however, after Georgia May went missing — and somehow managed to find her way home
to Carlsbad after a long, long trek.

 * COMIC-CON COVERAGE
   

On June 27, Anderson says she took her dog on a hike at the Penasquitos Canyon Preserve in San Diego. She admits she ignored a
posted sign saying dogs must be leashed at all times, which she said was probably her better judgment, in hindsight.

“I want to say [Georgia May] is half-wild. She’s run off a couple times,” Anderson explained.

 * HOW TO GET TO COMIC-CON
   

Perhaps not so surprisingly, it happened again.

But this time, Georgia didn't come back, and Anderson says she and a park ranger searched the trail until dark.

 * WOMAN HIT COP WITH BAG OF DOG POOP: POLICE
   

“And he said to me, ‘You know, I’m really sorry to say this, but dogs don’t make it through the night [at the Preserve]. It’s too
brutal,’” she recounted.

The Penasquitos Canyon Preserve is an area known for coyotes.

Still, Anderson says she went back every day in search of Georgia May, holding out hope for eight days before giving up.

“And in the end, I just thought, ‘A week and a couple days – no one can make it out there,’” she said.

But then, came day nine.

“And I work up and thought, ‘Am I dreaming. Wait,’” said Anderson.

Thirty-five miles from that trail, coming from her kitchen, Anderson heard the doggy door open and close.

“And she jumped up on my bed, just like that. [I said] ‘Georgia! Georgia!’” she added.

Anderson says her beloved canine companion has been lying on the couch, resting, pretty much ever since. She says a veterinarian
checked out Georgia May, and said her health is fine.

“She was quite skinny, but she’s gained some weight,” said Anderson.

How Georgia found her way home, we'll probably never know.

“I don't know,” said Anderson. “I would give anything to know the story.”

Well, she says, not quite anything.

“It sounds corny, I know, she's a dog – but to me she's my baby," Anderson told NBC 7. “I never thought I’d see her again, and
she’s special to me.”

miley cyrus Forget Kanye — here are the real stars of Madonna’s new video Why celebs are rushing to buy .porn domain names 5 best moments from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction Miley, James Franco and other celebs need an 'Insta-vention'This dog doesn’t wag his tail — he twerks.

A 16-year-old rescue pooch named Mervin the Chihuahua has tongues wagging on the Internet, as users marvel at his resemblance to
rump-shaking pop star Miley Cyrus.

The aging pup’s habit of letting his tongue flop lazily out of his mouth has been compared to the “Wrecking Ball” singer’s
signature facial gesture.

“I think people reference Miley Cyrus to Mervin because of that performance that she did when she was sticking her tongue out all
crazy,” the dog’s owner, Joey Teixeira, told Barcroft TV.

Mervin has gotten some 30,000 followers on Instagram. Cyrus, by comparison, has nearly 24 million.

“I was not expecting him to blow up the way he has,” Teixeira said.

   Shepherd's Veterinary Hospital in Mars, found proof of that inside her stomach when he surgically removed a variety of
   discoveries, including enough hair bands for nearly seven softball teams and enough underwear to last someone more than week.

   "'Doctor I' started pulling handfuls of different items out," Emily Cottle, his head vet technician, said. "It was quite an
   experience to see."
   
   Tiki's follow-up exam Wednesday showed the pet of the Weis family in Butler County is bouncing back quickly from her surgery
   last week.
   
   Tiki hadn't responded to medication to treat vomiting and diarrhea and lack of appetite, then x-rays showed a mysterious mass
   in her stomach.
   
   Ibrahim, known as "Doctor I" to his patients, performed nearly two hours of exploratory surgery.
   
   "And I found this hair band attached to another hair band to another one to another one and to other things again," Ibrahim
   said.
   
   "Four rubber bands, a Band-Aid, eight pairs of underwear and 62 hair bands is a lot to be in a dog's stomach, especially of
   Tiki's size," Cottle said.
   
   Removing it all was like a magician pulling a long string of scarves out of a hat.
   
   "That's exactly what's going on. It was just amazing, and it's not easy. But, thank God, we were able to pull through, and
   Tiki's recovered very well," Ibrahim said.
   
   Sara Weiss recalled the most unusual thing Tiki, her family's pet, had ever eaten prior to this.
   
   "A nerf dart," which the dog swallowed but passed through its system without surgery, said Weiss.
   
   Ibrahim told Pittsburgh's Action News 4 he recently surgically removed 15 pacifiers from the stomach of a different dog, but he
   called Tiki's case "really amazing."
   
   "I was there for the pacifiers and many other different items but not something that big (as Tiki's collection)," Cottle said.
   
   Ibraham said he believed Tiki ate the items over course of a few days.
   
   She'll be back at the veterinarian's office for another follow-up exam this Friday.

Every six months, the creative minds at Trick Dog come up with a new and unusual menu design. Past hits have included their original, and often copied, Pantone color wheel , one based on San Francisco tourist destinations and most recently, a Chinese restaurant takeout menu .

Well, time to meet the trendy Mission bar’s newest menu incarnation:

“Trick Dogs” — a 2016 calendar starring a dog and a cocktail for each month.

Dog models include the personal pets of The Bon Vivants’ Josh Harris and Morgan Schick, chef Thomas McNaughton, and calendar
photographer Sonya Yu.

Copies of the menu/calendar mashup, which also serves as a fully functional 2016 calendar, are available for purchase at the bar
for $20 each. All of the proceeds from calendar sales will be split between two local charities, Muttville Senior Dog Rescue and Northern California Family Dog Rescue .

Here’s the full menu:

 * January “Raja”: Jameson Black barrel whiskey, Gran Classico, shiso, vanilla, lemon, white sage, egg white

 * A Georgia woman has created a "bucket list" for her dying dog, Chester
 * Nicole Elliott got Chester last month from an animal shelter and agreed to foster him
 * In his final days, she's spoiling him with extra treats and oatmeal milk baths

(CNN) Nicole Elliott was browsing a Georgia animal shelter's Facebook page two weeks ago when she saw him: a scruffy charcoal-gray dog
with sad eyes.

His name was Chester. He was about 14 years old. And he was dying of cancer.

"Hospice needed," the profile said. Chester had mast cell tumors spreading throughout his little body. The shelter was looking for
someone willing to give him a home for the final weeks of his life.

The dog's story touched her. But who wants to foster a dying pet? Elliott stepped away from her computer, but she couldn't get
Chester and his plight out of her mind. The next day, she went to Animal Ark Rescue , signed some paperwork and brought Chester home.

"I only hope someone would do the same for me if I was terminally ill," she said.

Now Elliott, 24, has gone one step further. The Columbus, Georgia, woman has created a "bucket list" for Chester and is spoiling
him with extra treats, oatmeal milk baths and outings to parks. It's all documented on a Facebook page, " Chester's final journey ," that has more than 50,000 fans.


"I think he deserves it. He seems to have been neglected in his past life. He is such a sweet boy," said Elliott, who works as an
administrative assistant. "I have been trying to get a feel for what he is capable of, and most of the things are general doggy
things like going to the park and eating tons of treats."

Chester seems pretty sleepy today. I'm sure the meds are making him groggy. His tummy feels better though. He had a small "photo
shoot" today. Thanks to Charla for coming to us so we didn't have to leave the house. She got a few while he took a potty break
outside. You are a sweet lady! Can't wait to have those pictures forever! They will mean so much! We hope everyone is having a
great night. It's hard to respond to everyone, but know we feel ALL of the love. Thank you all so much! We are going to take it
easy tonight. Keep us in your thoughts and prayers. Xoxo 💙💙 Chester and Nikki

Over the past 10 days, Chester has been living like a king. He gets to eat pretty much anything he wants. He chews on squeaky toys
and enjoys belly rubs. On road trips, he sits on the center console of Elliott's car, where he can snuggle against her arm and
look out the windshield.

Although he is weak, Chester still wags his tail like mad when excited.

"He follows me everywhere, and when I walk out the door, he is usually right behind me. I can tell he has been enjoying all of the
love he has gotten. And the food is his favorite part," she said.

In the near future, Elliott hopes to take him on a day trip to the beach and maybe to visit sick kids or hospice patients to help
cheer them up.

"It all depends on him, though," she said. Elliott is sensitive to critics on Facebook who say too many bucket-list activities
will tire Chester out. "We don't want to make him do anything that makes him uncomfortable."

Chester appears to be a mixed breed -- maybe part miniature schnauzer. When he arrived at Animal Ark Rescue in April, his fur was
overgrown, and he had a large tumor under one leg.

"He had not been taken care of in a while," said Sabine Stull, the shelter's executive director.

The shelter cleaned him up and had the tumor surgically removed, only for others to soon appear. Resigned to the inevitable,
shelter staffers sought hospice care for Chester and were thrilled when Elliott showed up.

"It's absolutely wonderful what she's doing for him," said Stull. "It's really something. This is not an easy thing to do."

Veterinarians are not sure how much time Chester has left. It could be anywhere from days to several months, Elliott said. The dog
is on pain medication to keep him comfortable.

In the meantime, Chester's bucket list has brought international media attention and an outpouring of support on Facebook and Instagram . Elliott has started an online campaign to fund the hospice program at Animal Ark Rescue and is hoping Chester's story will inspire others to foster terminally ill dogs
and cats.

"All of the kind words and support help me get through it. I have cried many happy tears reading the comments," she said.

"It will be very hard (to say goodbye to him), but I know the legacy he is leaving behind makes it easier. I am already in love
with him and feel lucky to be there for the remainder of his life."

TIME Newsfeed animalsANDY MURRAY’S DOG IS THE BEST THING ON TWITTER
 * Tessa Berenson @tcberenson

7:41 AM ET SHAREANDY MURRAY'S DOG HAS ALMOST 30,000 TWITTER FOLLOWERS, AND HER TWEETS ARE AMAZING
Step aside, Kim Kardashian and J.K. Rowling: there’s a new celebrity ruling the Twittersphere. That celebrity’s name is Maggie
May, and she just happens to be a dog.

Tennis star Andy Murray’s dog, to be exact, and she has almost 30,000 Twitter followers.

She has impeccable selfie technique:

I've been off Twitter so long I've forgotten, is this how you take a selfie? pic.twitter.com/35FhifRnLA

— Maggie May (@maggiemay_hem) May 5, 2015

She uses cool abbreviations like “vaycay”:

I ask for a winter vaycay and they bring me to subzero NYC. My beard has frozen. pic.twitter.com/c3EVk2qsz2

— Maggie May (@maggiemay_hem) March 3, 2014

She throws shade at her owner’s competitors:

I've currently got more followers than @rogerfederer , enjoying it while it lasts… I'll even chuck him an early #ff

— Maggie May (@maggiemay_hem) May 23, 2013

And she’s also the master of the humble-brag:

#Wimbledogs pic.twitter.com/70FdISwkCQ

— Maggie May (@maggiemay_hem) July 9, 2013

Murray and his wife Kim Sears also have a dog named Rusty, who makes frequent appearances in Maggie May’s tweets. With Murray
currently on his way to the Wimbledon semifinals, we can’t wait to see what his loyal dog says next.

57 CONNECT 17 TWEET LINKEDIN 43 COMMENT EMAIL MOREChristopher Scott's attempt at euthanizing his dog with a crossbow arrow after it killed his smaller pug was not criminal, but
reasonable, and he had just cause to destroy the dog.

That's what his attorney is arguing in a motion to dismiss a felony animal cruelty charge against the Lapeer County man, saying
that Scott's failure in euthanizing his dog "does not render his actions criminal" and that Scott would have been guilty of
harboring a dangerous animal had he not taken any action.

If Scott had successfully killed the dog, named Gemma, "these charges would have never been issued," according to a brief
accompanying the motion.

Scott, 28, of Goodland Township is charged with felony animal cruelty and could be sentenced to four years in prison if convicted
of the charge filed after he shot Gemma in the head with the arrow in March. The approximately 2-year-old dog survived.

FREE PRESS Crossbow case: Can an owner euthanize his own dog?Scott's attorney, Denis McCarthy, is asking the case be dismissed. Lapeer District Court Visiting Judge John Conover did not rule
on the motion during the start of Scott's preliminary exam today. The exam is to continue July 23.

McCarthy wrote in his brief that Scott came home to find the pug, identified as Bambi during the exam, "lifeless in his bedroom and the Mastiff Labrador cross covered
in the pug's blood ... Mr. Scott was now aware that he owned a killer dog and he attempted to kill the dangerous dog to protect
his children, family, friends, and neighbors from other possible attacks."

McCarthy said children, one as young as 4 years old, lived in the home where Gemma killed the pug. Gemma is described as a
65-pound Mastiff Labrador mix while the pug weighed 20 pounds or less.

Scott does not own a gun but has a crossbow and used it in his attempt to euthanize Gemma, according to the brief, which does not
name either dog.

An Oakland County man found Gemma in North Branch in northern Lapeer County two days after she was shot, the 15- to 18-inch arrow
sticking out of the top of her head. Lapeer County Animal Control was notified, the arrow was removed and Gemma recovered and is being held at animal control's
facility.

McCarthy argued in his brief that the criminal statute Scott is charged under is to prevent people who do not have just cause from
knowingly killing, torturing, maiming or disfiguring an animal.

"It does not prohibit an attempt to kill an animal by a person who has just cause," it states, adding that the prosecution
"concede that Mr. Scott had every right to destroy his own animal. However, they insist that because Mr. Scott was unsuccessful in
killing his own dog, he committed a crime in violation of the statute at issue ... In fact, (the statute) provides no basis for a
criminal prosecution in this regard."

According to the brief, a necropsy on the pug found that the way the dog was killed is consistent with being mauled by another
dog. It also describes a dangerous dog as being one that bites or attacks and causes a serious injury or death to another dog.

Gemma, the brief states, "was and still is a dangerous animal. A person who knows that a dog is a dangerous animal and that dog
kills or injures another is guilty of a crime." It said Scott was was not willing to take a chance that the dog "would kill or
injure one of his children, family members or neighbors."

FREE PRESS Saving Gemma: 'My first thought was, is this a joke?'"He had a lawful reason to kill the dog and he attempted to do so. The statute does not criminalize a failed attempt to kill when
just cause exists to actually kill the animal."

The brief also notes that had the owners of the Mastiff-like Cane Corso dogs that mauled and killed a man in Lapeer County last
August euthanized their dangerous dogs, "the victim in that case would still be alive. Yet, here, Mr. Scott is being prosecuted."

The case last year marked the first time in Michigan in which dog owners were charged with murder after a fatal mauling. The
couple pleaded no contest to manslaughter after they were blamed for the death of a jogger who was attacked by their dogs. Their
sentencing is July 14.

Lapeer County Chief Animal Control Officer Aimee Orn testified today and -- when asked by Scott's attorney -- said that an owner
has the right to euthanize his or her own dog if it's done in a quick and humane manner. "It's justified ... if you do it
properly."

When asked what the plan was for Gemma, Orn said the dog does not belong to animal control "therefore we cannot make complete
plans yet." She has previously said that Gemma has not displayed any aggressive behaviors and she would like to find a home for her.

Orn, the lone witness today, testified her office received a call about Gemma being found with the arrow in her head and a tip led
to Scott being identified as Gemma's owner.

Orn said she talked with Scott on the phone, who told her that he had a pug that was killed by coyotes the previous weekend and
that he buried it in the backyard. He said he did not own a big black dog, but that he previously owned a large black pit bull but
it had been given away, she testified.

Orn testified that she sent animal control officers out to the neighborhood to inquire about whether Gemma was Scott's dog and
they determined she was. The county sheriff's office also got involved in the case.

Scott said little during the exam, but told Conover that he was not currently working when questioned about his availability to
continue the exam on another day.

Home > U.S.6-YEAR-OLD BOY KILLED BY DOG IN WESTERN NORTH CAROLINA
RALEIGH, N.C.  Jul 8, 2015, 6:10 PM ET By EMILY MASTERS Associated PressAssociated Press [http://a.abcnews.com/assets/images/logo/AP_logo_update_20130709.gif]

A pit bull mauled to death a 6-year-old boy who apparently had climbed over a 4-foot chain-link fence to get into a neighbor's
yard in western North Carolina , authorities said Wednesday.

The Henderson County Sheriff's Office was called to a residence in Hendersonville, south of Asheville, on Tuesday and found the
boy, Joshua Phillip Strother, lying unresponsive in the fenced backyard. The 1-year-old male pit bull there was so aggressive
officers had to shoot and kill the dog so emergency workers could get to the child, sheriff's office spokesman Maj. Frank Stout
said.

Resuscitation efforts were unsuccessful, and the boy died at the scene from wounds to his head and neck, Stout said.

"The child appeared to have died a very violent and quick death," Stout said.

The boy's mother, Amanda Strother, called 911 at 4:17 p.m. Tuesday and told the dispatcher she had gone to the bathroom and lost
sight of the boy for five to 10 minutes and then was unable to get into the neighbor's yard where he had been attacked.

"I was in the house and I heard the back door shut, and I come running and I see him lying in the neighbor's yard," the mother
told the dispatcher, according to the 911 recording of the conversation.

Weeping, she said there was blood on the boy's face and he didn't appear to be breathing. He did not respond when she called his
name and the neighbors were not home, she said.

After Animal Enforcement officers shot the dog, officers had to push down the chain-link fence to access the victim, Stout said.

Strother told the emergency dispatcher that her son and other children routinely climbed over the fence and had played with the
dog in the past. Strother's cousin Kathy Etheridge said Joshua was "just a sweet little blond-headed boy who loved to play
outside."

The neighbors adopted the dog from an animal shelter about three weeks ago, Stout said. The sheriff's office is investigating the
unnamed shelter and the dog's history to discover whether the animal has ever been deemed dangerous.
