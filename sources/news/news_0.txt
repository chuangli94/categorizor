prosecutor in Lapeer County, during Scott's preliminary exam July 8, 2015 in district court in Lapeer. Scott is facing an animal

Christopher Scott's attempt at euthanizing his dog with a crossbow arrow after it killed his smaller pug was not criminal, but
reasonable, and he had just cause to destroy the dog.

That's what his attorney is arguing in a motion to dismiss a felony animal cruelty charge against the Lapeer County man, saying
that Scott's failure in euthanizing his dog "does not render his actions criminal" and that Scott would have been guilty of
harboring a dangerous animal had he not taken any action.

If Scott had successfully killed the dog, named Gemma, "these charges would have never been issued," according to a brief
accompanying the motion.

Scott, 28, of Goodland Township is charged with felony animal cruelty and could be sentenced to four years in prison if convicted
of the charge filed after he shot Gemma in the head with the arrow in March. The approximately 2-year-old dog survived.

FREE PRESS Crossbow case: Can an owner euthanize his own dog?Scott's attorney, Denis McCarthy, is asking the case be dismissed. Lapeer District Court Visiting Judge John Conover did not rule
on the motion during the start of Scott's preliminary exam today. The exam is to continue July 23.

McCarthy wrote in his brief that Scott came home to find the pug, identified as Bambi during the exam, "lifeless in his bedroom and the Mastiff Labrador cross covered
in the pug's blood ... Mr. Scott was now aware that he owned a killer dog and he attempted to kill the dangerous dog to protect
his children, family, friends, and neighbors from other possible attacks."

McCarthy said children, one as young as 4 years old, lived in the home where Gemma killed the pug. Gemma is described as a
65-pound Mastiff Labrador mix while the pug weighed 20 pounds or less.

Scott does not own a gun but has a crossbow and used it in his attempt to euthanize Gemma, according to the brief, which does not
name either dog.

An Oakland County man found Gemma in North Branch in northern Lapeer County two days after she was shot, the 15- to 18-inch arrow
sticking out of the top of her head. Lapeer County Animal Control was notified, the arrow was removed and Gemma recovered and is being held at animal control's
facility.

McCarthy argued in his brief that the criminal statute Scott is charged under is to prevent people who do not have just cause from
knowingly killing, torturing, maiming or disfiguring an animal.

"It does not prohibit an attempt to kill an animal by a person who has just cause," it states, adding that the prosecution
"concede that Mr. Scott had every right to destroy his own animal. However, they insist that because Mr. Scott was unsuccessful in
killing his own dog, he committed a crime in violation of the statute at issue ... In fact, (the statute) provides no basis for a
criminal prosecution in this regard."

According to the brief, a necropsy on the pug found that the way the dog was killed is consistent with being mauled by another
dog. It also describes a dangerous dog as being one that bites or attacks and causes a serious injury or death to another dog.

Gemma, the brief states, "was and still is a dangerous animal. A person who knows that a dog is a dangerous animal and that dog
kills or injures another is guilty of a crime." It said Scott was was not willing to take a chance that the dog "would kill or
injure one of his children, family members or neighbors."

FREE PRESS Saving Gemma: 'My first thought was, is this a joke?'"He had a lawful reason to kill the dog and he attempted to do so. The statute does not criminalize a failed attempt to kill when
just cause exists to actually kill the animal."

The brief also notes that had the owners of the Mastiff-like Cane Corso dogs that mauled and killed a man in Lapeer County last
August euthanized their dangerous dogs, "the victim in that case would still be alive. Yet, here, Mr. Scott is being prosecuted."

The case last year marked the first time in Michigan in which dog owners were charged with murder after a fatal mauling. The
couple pleaded no contest to manslaughter after they were blamed for the death of a jogger who was attacked by their dogs. Their
sentencing is July 14.

Lapeer County Chief Animal Control Officer Aimee Orn testified today and -- when asked by Scott's attorney -- said that an owner
has the right to euthanize his or her own dog if it's done in a quick and humane manner. "It's justified ... if you do it
properly."

When asked what the plan was for Gemma, Orn said the dog does not belong to animal control "therefore we cannot make complete
plans yet." She has previously said that Gemma has not displayed any aggressive behaviors and she would like to find a home for her.

Orn, the lone witness today, testified her office received a call about Gemma being found with the arrow in her head and a tip led
to Scott being identified as Gemma's owner.

Orn said she talked with Scott on the phone, who told her that he had a pug that was killed by coyotes the previous weekend and
that he buried it in the backyard. He said he did not own a big black dog, but that he previously owned a large black pit bull but
it had been given away, she testified.

Orn testified that she sent animal control officers out to the neighborhood to inquire about whether Gemma was Scott's dog and
they determined she was. The county sheriff's office also got involved in the case.

Scott said little during the exam, but told Conover that he was not currently working when questioned about his availability to
continue the exam on another day.
